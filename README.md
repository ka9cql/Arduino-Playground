# Arduino-Playground
Some simple Arduino projects (mostly as experiments)

First program is a Burglar Alarm that uses a PIR (Passive Infared) motion sensor to detect intruders. It has a keypad and two different passcodes to enable and disable the alarm. It is inspired from code found here - https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/thehack904/motion-sensing-alarm-with-keypad-password-53f05c.  (CAUTION: The circuit diagram at that URL is inaccurate.)
